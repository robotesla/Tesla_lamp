M5Stack (Five Stack Em) is a large innovative set for technical creativity.
We were the first to discover the latest era in technical creativity and create a family of functional blocks. Bad contact, surface mounting, circuit boards without a case are now a thing of the past.
The community is dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT) on an ESP32 microcontroller from ESPRESSIF and a Kendryte K210 neural network chip.
Our official Russian-speaking community has lessons, reviews, articles, podcasts, contests and much more. Participants enthusiastically discuss current issues and share experiences.
